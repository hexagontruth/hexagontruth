## Introduction

A Hexagon Truth static site, recently totally revamped.

This started as a fork of the hexagon.link site to allow me to differentiate my brands a bit more, and also maybe lay the foundations for a more robust e.g. personal portfolio site going forward. I am now redoing it as a Vue application. I generally hate FE frameworks and this is possibly not a great use case, but I wanted to at least get better at using Vue in personal projects. Also Webpack, which I also hate, and fills me with unease vis-a-vis its dependency top-heaviness, etc., but which I really just need to get used to using routinely. Anyway, nothing about this is really put together well at this point, but I'm hoping it will serve as a sort of basic scaffolding for building out a more robust, interactive Hexagon Truth "web experience" going forward.
